# Michael Gannon - Future Data Analyst
*Cork Ireland | Project Manager transitioning to Data Analytics*

I'm a project manager with a passion for using data to uncover business insights and guide smarter decisions. After several rewarding years leading projects at Fexco, I’m now focusing on expanding my skill set to pursue a career in data analytics and business intelligence.

I’m currently upskilling through DataCamp and Coursera, building my technical foundation in SQL, Tableau, and data visualization. This repository documents my learning journey and showcases the portfolio projects I’m developing along the way.

My goal for 2026 is to secure an entry-level Data Analyst or BI Analyst role in Ireland—bringing together my project management experience and growing data expertise to deliver meaningful insights.

## Aspirations & Upskilling Journey
After several years as a Project Manager at Fexco, I’m channeling my curiosity for data-driven decision-making into a transition toward Data Analytics. I’m actively completing self-paced learning in SQL, Tableau, and Snowflake, focusing on the tools and techniques that power effective business intelligence.

This repository will feature portfolio projects that demonstrate how I apply analytical thinking, visualization, and storytelling to real-world datasets. I’m especially interested in uncovering insights that support strategic planning and operational improvement.

I’m eager to connect with teams across Ireland seeking motivated entry-level or junior Data Analysts who bring both business awareness and analytical rigor. Stay tuned for project updates as my learning progresses!
